# Pando Prompt Server Design Document

## 1. Introduction

The Pando Prompt Server is a robust, scalable solution for deploying, managing, and executing Pando prompts. Built with Nest.js, it provides a comprehensive environment for prompt execution, scheduling, and monitoring.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The Pando Prompt Server is designed as a modular, microservices-based application using Nest.js. The main components are:

1. API Gateway
2. Prompt Management Service
3. Execution Engine
4. Scheduler Service
5. Configuration Service
6. Logging and Auditing Service
7. Authentication and Authorization Service

### 2.2 Technology Stack

- Framework: Nest.js
- Language: TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL (for storing prompts, configurations, and execution logs)
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ (for handling asynchronous tasks and inter-service communication)
- Caching: Redis (for improving performance and storing temporary data)
- Container Orchestration: Kubernetes (for deployment and scaling)

## 3. Detailed Component Design

### 3.1 API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests. It handles:

- Request routing to appropriate microservices
- API versioning
- Rate limiting
- Request/response transformation

#### Key Endpoints:

- POST /api/v1/prompts: Create a new prompt
- GET /api/v1/prompts: List all prompts
- GET /api/v1/prompts/:id: Get a specific prompt
- PUT /api/v1/prompts/:id: Update a prompt
- DELETE /api/v1/prompts/:id: Delete a prompt
- POST /api/v1/execute/:id: Execute a prompt
- POST /api/v1/schedule: Schedule a prompt execution

### 3.2 Prompt Management Service

This service is responsible for CRUD operations on prompts. It includes:

- Prompt storage and retrieval
- Version control for prompts
- Prompt validation

### 3.3 Execution Engine

The Execution Engine is the core component responsible for running Pando prompts. It includes:

- Prompt parsing and validation
- Integration with various AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Execution of custom tools defined in prompts
- Result processing and storage

### 3.4 Scheduler Service

The Scheduler Service manages periodic execution of prompts. It includes:

- Cron-like scheduling capabilities
- Execution queue management
- Retry mechanisms for failed executions

### 3.5 Configuration Service

This service manages global and prompt-specific configurations, including:

- AI provider settings
- Execution environment configurations
- Rate limiting and quota management

### 3.6 Logging and Auditing Service

This service is responsible for:

- Detailed logging of all prompt executions
- Audit trail for prompt modifications
- Performance metrics collection
- Integration with external monitoring tools (e.g., ELK stack)

### 3.7 Authentication and Authorization Service

Handles user authentication and authorization, including:

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key management for external integrations

## 4. Data Model

### 4.1 Prompt

```typescript
interface Prompt {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: number;
  content: string; // The actual Pando prompt content
  creator: string;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
  is_active: boolean;
}
```

### 4.2 Execution

```typescript
interface Execution {
  id: string;
  prompt_id: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  input: object;
  output: object;
  started_at: Date;
  completed_at: Date;
  error?: string;
}
```

### 4.3 Schedule

```typescript
interface Schedule {
  id: string;
  prompt_id: string;
  cron_expression: string;
  is_active: boolean;
  last_execution: Date;
  next_execution: Date;
}
```

## 5. Key Processes

### 5.1 Prompt Execution Flow

1. Client sends execution request to API Gateway
2. Request is validated and routed to Execution Engine
3. Execution Engine retrieves prompt from Prompt Management Service
4. Prompt is parsed and validated
5. Execution Engine runs the prompt, interfacing with AI providers as needed
6. Results are processed and stored
7. Execution details are logged by Logging and Auditing Service
8. Response is sent back to the client

### 5.2 Scheduled Execution Flow

1. Scheduler Service identifies prompts due for execution
2. Execution requests are sent to a message queue
3. Execution Engine consumes messages from the queue
4. Steps 3-7 from the Prompt Execution Flow are followed
5. Scheduler Service updates the next execution time

## 6. Scalability and Performance

- Use of microservices architecture allows for independent scaling of components
- Kubernetes for container orchestration and auto-scaling
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Database indexing and query optimization
- Asynchronous processing using message queues for improved throughput

## 7. Security Considerations

- All API endpoints protected with JWT authentication
- HTTPS encryption for all communications
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Secure storage of sensitive data (e.g., API keys) using Kubernetes Secrets
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

- Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and alerting
- Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Regular backups of database and configurations
- Automated testing pipeline for continuous integration and deployment

## 9. Future Enhancements

- Support for more AI providers
- Advanced analytics dashboard for prompt performance
- A/B testing capabilities for prompts
- Integration with popular CI/CD tools for automated prompt deployment
- Support for federated learning and multi-model execution

## 10. Conclusion

The Pando Prompt Server design provides a robust, scalable, and secure platform for managing and executing Pando prompts. Its modular architecture allows for easy expansion and maintenance, while the use of modern technologies ensures high performance and reliability.
